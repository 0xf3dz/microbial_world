Microbes have a limited sense of consciousness.
As far as we can tell, they understand the boundaries of their body. 
Therefore, they are aware of when they get into contact with another microbe.
This allows them to predate.

However, microbes do not seem to have a sense of space beyond this: they seem to move randomly until they randomly stumble upon their next meal.
Since microbes have successfully sustained life on earth for millions of years, this works quite effectively.

We will simulate the random path of microbe movement and predation.
We will create a `Microbe` object class.
We will endow this class with methods to simulate random movement, tracking position and direction in a 10 by 10 space.
Then, creating two instances of microbes, we will let them randomly explore the space till one eats the other.
